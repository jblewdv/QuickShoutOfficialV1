				h3 How To Use:
				p QuickShout is designed to connect with your Instagram account and locate the Direct Messages that relate to paid promotions and shoutouts. It does this once every single day at 12:00pm CST (Central Standard Time). In the future, you will be able to customize the times that the software runs. 
				p To start QuickShout, simply press the "Start Running" button below. We will handle everything else after that. Once you start the software, it will run automatically - nothing else needs to be done on your part.
				p When QuickShout has finished running for the day after 12:00pm, you can find the results under the "Leads" tab on the left-hand side. You will be shown the Instagram Profile Picture and Username of each person inquiring about a paid promotion or shoutout, as well as the status of the interaction.
